# Personal Card

This is my personal digital business card.

## Usage

Via npx:

```
npx johnbwoodruff
```

## Inspiration

I was inspired to create this digital business card by Tierney Cyren and [his own card](https://github.com/bnb/bitandbang). It's such a cool idea to run a simple `npx` command and get info about me and where to find my work. Plus, I doubt anyone will ever want to write an npm package called `johnbwoodruff`, so I figured I wasn't being irresponsible. ðŸ¤—
